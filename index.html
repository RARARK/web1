  <p>For followers, the Bolivier is still the storm itself.
  <br>Powerful, savage and stubbornly determined,
  <br>he existed even before the mortal appeared in Freeljord's frozen land.
  <br>Bolivier, who greatly cared about the land
  <br>he had built with other deities, loathed the development of a weak civilization,
  <br>and eventually began to fight to regain the old tradition
  <br>that had been rough and violent.
  <br>Whoever stands in his way will taste the teeth, claws, and thunder of the Bolivier.</p>
